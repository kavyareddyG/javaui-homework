                                                   Javascript Homework-1

1)Javascript datatypes?
           In Javascript we have datatypes like 
 a)undefined
 b)number
 c)Boolean
 d)object
 e)function
 f) Array and Null are the sub classifications of object.
 g)string

a)undefined: when the variable is declared and didn't assigned any value to a variable then the type would be undefined.

For ex: var a;
        console.log(typeof a);
o/p: Undefined.

2)number : when the variable is declared and assigned the value to it then the type would be number.

For ex: var b;
        b=1;
        console.log(typeof b);
o/p: number

3)string : If we assign any value in string format then the type would be string.

For ex: var c;
     c="micky mouse";
    console.log(typeof c);
o/p : string

4)object: If we declare any empty object then the type would be object.

For ex: var d;
       d={};
       console.log(typeof d)
o/p: object

5)For null and array datatypes the type would be object.

For ex: d=null;
        console.log(typeof d)
o/p: object

     d=[]
     console.log(typeof d)
o/p:object

6) Boolean: if we assign the value as true or false then the type would be boolean.
         for ex: var c;
                 c= true;
                 console.log(typeof c);
        o/p: boolean.

7)function : The type of function is function.

            ex: var a;
                a=function() {}
                console.log(typeof a);
        o/p: function.

2)Difference between Null and Undefined?

       A variable has declared and not assigned any value to that variable. The unassigned variables are initialised by the javascript wth a default value of 
     undefined.
       Null is the assignment value. It is assigned as the representation of no value.
            Ex: var a=null;

3)Difference between == and ===?
        
           == is only a value comparison but not datatype comparison.
              console.log(1==1); //true
              console.log('1'==1); //true
              console.log(null==undefined); //true (because null and undefined means no value.)

          === is both value and datatype comparison.
               console.log(1===1); //true
               console.log('1'===1); // false.
               console.log(null===undefined);//false

4)How to include javascript into web pages?
      1) We can include the internal javascript within the <script> tag
   Ex: <script>
          //we can include the javascript
       </script>

   2) If we had any external javascript file then we need to include it in the script tag.
        Ex: <script src="filename.js"></script>

5)Why we need to use Javascript?
   small applications and games can be entirely written in javascript.
   For DOM manipulation, Event handling, BOM, different way of creating objects,arrays,functions, oops concepts and Ajax calls.

6)what is DOM Manipulation?
   DOM stands for Document Object Model.
   When the web page gets loaded, browser creates DOM of the page.
   Html is read by browser and converted into tree like structure and event handling operations can be done on DOM.
